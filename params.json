Who loves to play soccer, snowboard and Brazilian JiuJitsu. Growing up in London, I have a place for grime and EDM but more enthusiastic about \"Drill\" music and some Bach. Which is a weird mix as they have different textures and rhythm but synonymous seem to go hand in hand. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nCheck out our Tumblr/Vine\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
